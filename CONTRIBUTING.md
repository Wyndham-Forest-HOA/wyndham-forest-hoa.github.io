# Guiding Principles

Here are some of our guiding principles for our code changes:

* Easy to understand - In our neighborhood, we have young, inexperienced, developers and we
have developers with decades of experience. Its important that everyone's able to understand
the code. We don't use any fancy libraries or complicated code structure. For the most part,
everything is confined to a single file.
* Easy to maintain - All of us are volunteers that live busy lives. Most of us don't have time
to make weekly, or even monthly, changes to the site. Information that's short-lived or changes
often is better suited for one of our social media channels.

If you ever have a question or want help with your code changes, don't hesitate to reach out to the
other developers in the neighborhood.
